-- Package Sockets_Overlay
-- Purpose: Contrains types definitions, functions and procedures
--   usefull for sockets manipulations such as IO and configuration.
--
-- Extra: Currently the sockets and channels are declared as global
--   variables in the package since we know that we only have 1 client
--   and 1 server using specifically 3 sockets: simple -> better
--   Implementation should be changed if tasks are added / multiple
--   connections clients. (clients list)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
package Sockets_Overlay is

  Address               : Sock_Addr_Type; 

  Server                : Socket_Type;  
  Data_Socket           : Socket_Type;  
  Command_Socket        : Socket_Type;  
  Temp_Socket           : Socket_Type;
  Ack_Socket            : Socket_Type;

  Data_Channel          : GNAT.Sockets.Stream_Access;
  Command_Channel       : GNAT.Sockets.Stream_Access;
  Temp_Channel          : GNAT.Sockets.Stream_Access;
  Ack_Channel           : GNAT.Sockets.Stream_Access;

  Socket_Mode_Activated : Boolean := False;

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- Connect_Socket
  -- Purpose: Used to make a simple connection between a client and the server.
  --          - Only a listen and accept statement.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  procedure Connect_Socket (
    Serv    : in out Socket_Type;
    Client  : in out Socket_Type;
    Addr    : in     Sock_Addr_Type;
    Channel : in out GNAT.Sockets.Stream_Access);

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- Get_Command_Value
  -- Purpose: Return the value passed as argument of a socket command.
  --   The value of a command is in this format:
  --   "my_command [my_value]"
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  function Get_Command_Value (
    Command : Unbounded_String) 
    return    String;  

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- Initialize_Socket
  -- Purpose: Used to initialize a socket.
  --      - Only a bind and accept statement.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  procedure Initialize_Socket (
    Address : in     Sock_Addr_Type;
    Serv    : in out Socket_Type);

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- Read
  -- Purpose: Read data on the socket channel.
  --
  -- Extra: At first, Read_Channel was used to get the input on sockets,
  --   tests was made between 2 ADA programs and no problem was detected.
  --   Since the connection is made between an ADA program (Cheddar) and an 
  --   other one (AADLInspector) the Read_Channel procedure wasn't functionnal
  --   anymore.
  --  
  --   The procedure was locked in a waiting state on reading Inputs from
  --   AADLInspector. After multiples tests and modifications, no solution was
  --   spotted. After internet research on GNAT.Socket documentation and
  --   code documentation of specification and body files no clue on the issue
  --   was found. A network analysis showed unspecifed data before the message
  --   sended from an ADA program.
  --  
  --   Indeed, it was found later that GNAT.Socket is adding a layer on top of
  --   the message. As said before, this layer was not specified on the
  --   GNAT.Socket documentation and was only spotted in a book: lien du livre.
  --   GNAT.Socket uses a specific communication protocol over the TCP stack,
  --   while sending a string with String'Output(s), the string is transmitted
  --   under the following form:
  --       * an integer with value 1 on 4 bytes in binary followed by,
  --       * an integer on 4 bytes in binary wich is the string length,
  --       * and then the characters of the string s.
  --   The function String'Input only accept this format too.
  --  
  --   So, this is a issue that you need to be aware if you try to communicate
  --   between an Ada program and another program written in another language.
